# AutoFileSave
This Python project was inspired by a YouTube video on the best projects to improve programming.
This project aims to solve the issue of downloading files and saving them in the correct folders according to extensions and names.
This will use Python automation to sort file extensions and name recognition to sort files into the specified folders.
